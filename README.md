# **Curriculum Vitae**- *Quantitative Researcher*
Discovering a passion that combines my *love for numbers, curiosity, and results* was a dream to reality. Actively looking to fulfil this dream through a *Data Science* related role (***Data Analytics, Research Analyst, Quantitative Science, Digital Marketing Coordinator***). I hope to add value to a group working towards the same goal ASAP.

## Personal Projects :star2:
  - [Ethereum Mining Report](https://github.com/akeyess/Eth_Mining_Research)
    
    
  Compares revenue from personal Ethereum miner to the reported average revenue of Ethereum miners relative to megahash. This study discovered how my miner performs against the network average in terms of revenue. Findings fail to reject the hypotheis: "Personal ETH miner revenue will perform lower overall in comparison to reported average ETH mining revenue".
  
    Data Aggreagation, Quantitative Transformation, Statistical Analysis, 
    Data Visualization, Results Implications
    
  - Personal Running Research
  
  Future study to investigate if a relationship exists between workout performance and training run pace. In the past I did not respect easy days as much as I should have. As of recent months I have been slowing down easy training days and been feeling stronger when it comes to workout performance. I believe over the past 6 month we will see a slow down in easy running pace to correlate with an increase in workout performance.
