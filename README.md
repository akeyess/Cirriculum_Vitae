# **Curriculum Vitae**- *Quantitative Researcher*
#### Discovering a passion aggregated of my *love for numbers, curiosity, and results* was a dream brought to reality. I am actively looking to fulfil this dream through a *Data Science* related role (***Data Analytics, Research Analyst, Quantitative Science, Digital Marketing Coordinator***). I hope to add value to a group working towards the same goal ASAP.

## Personal Projects :star2:
  - [Ethereum Mining Report](https://github.com/akeyess/Eth_Mining_Research)
    
    - A study comparing the revenue of my personal Ethereum miner to the reported average revenue of Ethereum miners relative to megahash. Discovered how the personal miner performs against the network average in terms of revenue, slightly under. As expected findings ***fail to reject the hypotheis***: "**Personal ETH miner revenue will perform lower overall in comparison to reported average ETH mining revenue**".

  - Personal Running Research
  
    - Future study to investigate if a relationship exists between workout performance and training run pace. In the past I think I did not respect easy days as much as I should have. As of recent months I have been slowing down easy training days and been feeling stronger when it comes to workout performance. ***I believe over the past 6 months we will see a slow down in easy running pace correlate with an increase in workout performance***.

## Institutional Research Reports 📖
  ### The Correlation Between Screen Time and Level of Social Anxiety in College Students 
- ***California State University, Stanislaus, 2021***
***Summer."Research Seminar in Social Psychology"***
  
  - Study exploring the relationship between total screen time using electronic media and levels of social anxiety. All participants (n=39) were psychology undergraduate students from a research seminar class. *Screen time was assessed in hours per week*, while *social anxiety used the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale*. ***A Pearson’s Correlation in SPSS*** found the results were not significant. ***The results did not support our hypothesis*** of participants’ screen time and level of social anxiety being correlated. Future research on this topic should include a survey measuring depression levels, as well as types of technological screens used.

### Lifetime Prison Sentence and Levels of Depression 
- ***California State University, Stanislaus, 2021***
  ***Spring. "Experimental Methods and Design"***
  
  - ***Research proposal*** investigating the question "*Does the duration of a life sentence impact a prisoner’s level of depression*?". ***Stratified sampling*** will be introduced to 4 prisons, collecting 400 applicants total. A randomizer bot will pick 100 participants from each prison, collecting an equal amount in four sentence-length groups: *0-9 years, 10-19 years, 20-29 years, and life sentence*. A 20 item self-report inventory will be used to measure symptoms of depression and severity of depression. The inventory will be adapted from the *Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Hopelessness Scale*. For inferential statistics, an ***analysis of variance (ANOVA)*** will determine if effects from length of incarceration on depression levels exists. If the ANOVA is significant, a ***Tukey post hoc test*** will determine differences between the groups. To conclude a relationship between incarceration and depression, ***a regression line and correlational test*** will find out the strength of correlation. A ***t-test*** will be run on the assessment results to evaluate if a significant difference exists between our participants, incarcerated individuals, and the general public, individuals not currently incarcerated.

  ### Smartphones: The Connection College Students Make 
- ***Modesto Junior College, 2020***
  ***Spring. "Research Methods"***
  
  - Experiment *tesing if people who use smartphones ( i.e. games, videos, email, text, calling, etc.) in social settings ( i.e. cafeteria, hallways, school events, etc.) will have fewer new connections than people who do not use cell phones in social situations*. Participants (n=12) were questioned about phone use duration while at school as well as amount of new friends made on campus. A one-way ANOVA found no significant difference of new connections made among participants at the p<.05 level as determined by ***one way ANOVA [F(2,9) =0.642, p=0.548]***. Visual analysis depicts a greater amount of friends made in participants with high smartphone useage compared to those with low smartphone useage.
